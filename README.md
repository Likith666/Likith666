### 🕹️ VR Cube-Based Cognitive Test
- An interactive VR application that evaluates cognitive abilities through a dynamic colored-cube experiment. Users respond to cubes based on color and sequence, testing reaction time, focus, and short-term memory in an immersive environment.
- Cubes with parts of an image appear in random sequences. The user must respond to specific targets, and the system records accuracy and response timing.  
**Tools:** Unity 3D, XR Toolkit, Oculus Quest 2
